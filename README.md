# React Practice Project

This project is meant to be a practice project for learning React. At the moment there is no plan -- this file will be updated with a plan for the project.

Link to project: (will be linked as project is developed to MVP)

## How It's Made:
### Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vite (?)

My plan is to practice React, so the project will include HTML, CSS and vanilla JS but will mostly be focused on React features. This app was started with Vite as well.

## Optimizations

None yet, but leaving a section.

## Lessons Learned:

A section to record some of my biggest lessons and areas of growth while practicing React.


### React + Vite

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
